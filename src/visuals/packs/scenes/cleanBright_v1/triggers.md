# CleanBright v1 — Triggers (Implemented)

Full-bleed background shifts act like a **scene change**.

## Allowed triggers (pivotal moments only)
- Enter new phase/section
- Switch roadmap/project
- Milestone reached (phase complete / next-up begins)
- Return-to-Now focus

## Disallowed
- Continuous shifting on scroll
- Background motion that competes with content

## Reduce motion
- Use instant scene swap (no crossfade) when `reduceMotion=true`.
