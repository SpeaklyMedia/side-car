# Luxury Motion v1 (Implemented)

This pack defines motion tokens + named sequences for a calm "luxury" feel.

## Principles
- Slower-than-default durations (breathable)
- Staggered reveals (frame → label → value → detail)
- No constant motion; loops only when active

## Reduce motion
Use the `reduce_motion` variant to disable:
- looping flow/shimmer
- rolodex tick
- slide enter/exit transitions
